        <p> What are the highest grossing movies of all time? </p>
             </br>
        <p> It might surprise you that four of the 25 highest-grossing movies of all time came out in 2018,
            and 2019 added another three: Avengers: Endgame now tops the worldwide box office list,
            the “don’t call it a live-action” remake of The Lion King has cracked the Top 10,
            and Frozen II was no slouch either. Those stats, of course, are skewed by rising ticket prices and increases in population.
           
           As an increasing number of films find global audiences, their box office totals just compound.
           And rankings of these totals are ever changing, as blockbusters both predictable and unexpected are released.</p>
